Concerning typing <%^BOLD%^who%^RESET%^>...

1.) Why do I not see any names on the "who" listing?

People on the who listing are currently unknown to you. You will first have to <%^BOLD%^recognize%^RESET%^> them before you will be able to call them by name (including yourself). This allows for player's to provide nicknames, or even false names, rather than their real name. Please see <%^BOLD%^help recognize%^RESET%^> for more information.
